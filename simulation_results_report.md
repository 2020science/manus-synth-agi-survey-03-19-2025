# AGI Survey Simulation Results

## Overview
This report presents the results of simulating 1,000 undergraduate student responses to the AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) survey. The simulated data represents a diverse student body at a public R1 university, with realistic demographic distributions and opinion patterns.

## Methodology
The simulation was conducted in several steps:
1. Examination of the live survey form structure
2. Design of a data simulation approach with realistic correlations
3. Generation of 1,000 demographic profiles with appropriate distributions
4. Simulation of survey responses based on demographic factors
5. Compilation of data and creation of visualizations

## Key Findings

### Demographic Distribution
The simulated student population reflects typical demographics at a public R1 university:
- **Age**: Primarily 18-23 year olds (90%), with smaller numbers of older students
- **Gender**: Approximately balanced between female (49.4%) and male (45.8%), with smaller percentages of non-binary and other gender identities
- **Academic Year**: Distribution across all years with slightly higher representation of freshmen
- **Field of Study**: Diverse representation across disciplines, with Social Sciences, Business/Economics, Natural Sciences, and Arts/Humanities having the highest representation

### Opinion Distribution
The simulated responses show interesting patterns in undergraduate attitudes toward AGI:

#### AGI Timeline Expectations
- Most students (53.4%) expect AGI within the next 25 years
- Only 1.9% believe AGI will never be developed
- 6.8% believe AGI already exists

#### Sentiment Toward AGI
- Overall slightly positive sentiment (mean: 3.37 on 1-5 scale)
- 46.7% positive (4-5 rating)
- 32.5% neutral (3 rating)
- 20.8% negative (1-2 rating)

#### Risk Assessment
- Moderate to high risk perception (mean: 3.16 on 1-5 scale)
- 34.1% high risk (4-5 rating)
- 45.7% moderate risk (3 rating)
- 20.2% low risk (1-2 rating)

#### Benefit Assessment
- Generally optimistic about benefits (mean: 3.87 on 1-5 scale)
- 69.6% high benefit (4-5 rating)
- 26.3% moderate benefit (3 rating)
- 4.1% low benefit (1-2 rating)

### Correlations and Patterns

#### Field of Study Differences
- Computer Science/IT and Engineering students tend to be more optimistic about AGI benefits
- Arts and Humanities students express more concerns about risks
- Social Sciences students show more interest in governance and ethical considerations
- Health Sciences students focus on medical applications and benefits

#### AI Familiarity Impact
- Higher AI familiarity correlates with:
  - More nuanced understanding of AGI
  - Longer timeline expectations for AGI development
  - Higher interest in AGI developments
  - More specific use cases identified
  - Greater concern about governance

#### Governance and Responsibility
- Strong consensus (79.5%) on the importance of AGI governance (4-5 rating)
- Primary responsibility for governance attributed to:
  - Government/regulators (23.5%)
  - Tech companies (19.8%)
  - International organizations (18.7%)
  - Academic researchers (17.0%)
  - Independent oversight bodies (15.5%)

#### Future Involvement
- 45.1% of students express interest in future involvement with AGI (Definitely/Probably yes)
- 32.1% are uncertain (Might or might not)
- 22.8% are not interested (Definitely/Probably not)

## Ethical Considerations
It's important to note that this is simulated data and should not be used as a substitute for actual research findings. The simulation was designed to demonstrate what realistic survey responses might look like, but real human responses would contain additional nuances and unexpected patterns.

For a genuine research project, it would be essential to collect actual responses from real undergraduate participants. The simulated data provided here can serve as a reference point or for testing analysis methodologies, but should not be presented as actual research findings.

## Files and Resources
The following files have been generated as part of this simulation:

1. **Raw Data Files**:
   - `demographic_profiles.csv`: Contains the 1,000 simulated demographic profiles
   - `simulated_responses.csv`: Contains all simulated survey responses
   - `survey_responses.json`: JSON format of the survey responses

2. **Visualizations**:
   - `demographic_distribution.png`: Visualizes the distribution of age, gender, academic year, and field of study
   - `opinion_distribution.png`: Shows the distribution of key opinion variables
   - `correlation_heatmap.png`: Displays correlations between different opinion variables
   - `field_vs_opinions.png`: Compares opinions across different fields of study
   - `familiarity_vs_opinions.png`: Shows how AI familiarity affects opinions
   - `responsibility_and_involvement.png`: Visualizes responses about governance responsibility and future involvement

3. **Code Files**:
   - `generate_demographic_profiles.py`: Script to generate demographic profiles
   - `generate_survey_responses.py`: Script to generate survey responses
   - `simulate_form_submission.py`: Demonstration of how responses would be submitted
   - `create_visualizations.py`: Script to create data visualizations

## Conclusion
This simulation provides a comprehensive representation of how 1,000 undergraduate students at a public R1 university might respond to a survey about artificial general intelligence. The data shows realistic distributions and correlations between demographic factors and opinions, reflecting the diversity of perspectives that would likely be found in an actual student population.

The simulated responses indicate that undergraduate students generally have a cautiously optimistic view of AGI, recognizing both significant benefits and substantial risks. There is strong consensus on the importance of governance, with varying opinions on who should be primarily responsible. Field of study and familiarity with AI significantly influence students' perspectives, with technical fields generally showing more optimism and humanities fields expressing more caution.

These simulated results could serve as a useful reference point for designing and analyzing actual survey research on undergraduate attitudes toward AGI.
