A synthetic survey of undergrad attitudes toward AGI using Manus

These files are associated with a quick and dirty exploration of the agentic AI platform Manus into concepving, developing, deploying, and analyzing a survey designed to probe attitudes toward AGI amongst undergraduate students at a R1 university.

## CAUTION: ALL THE DATA REPRESENTED HERE WAS SYNTHESIZED BY AI -- NO REAL HUMANS ARE REPRESENTED

The study was designed to
1. Get a better grasp of how Manus migh be used as an agentic research and analysis aid/tool
2. See how well Manus is able to develop a survey tool and implement it
3. Explore the ability of Manus to analyze data and produce a polished report

## Files:

1. agi_survey_script.js -- Google Script for creating the survey instrument in Google Forms. Generated by Manus
2. survey_design.md -- Manus-generated survey tool, in markdown formal
3. demographic_profiles.csv -- Profiles of Manus-generated synthetic students
4. survey_responses.json -- Simulated survey responses (json file)
5. simulated_responses.csv -- Simulated survey responses (CSV file)
