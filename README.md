A synthetic survey of undergrad attitudes toward AGI using Manus

These files are associated with a quick and dirty exploration of the agentic AI platform Manus into concepving, developing, deploying, and analyzing a survey designed to probe attitudes toward AGI amongst undergraduate students at a R1 university.

See below for the prompts used

## CAUTION: ALL THE DATA REPRESENTED HERE WAS SYNTHESIZED BY AI -- NO REAL HUMANS ARE REPRESENTED

The study was designed to
1. Get a better grasp of how Manus migh be used as an agentic research and analysis aid/tool
2. See how well Manus is able to develop a survey tool and implement it
3. Explore the ability of Manus to analyze data and produce a polished report

## Files:

1. agi_survey_script.js -- Google Script for creating the survey instrument in Google Forms. Generated by Manus
2. survey_design.md -- Manus-generated survey tool, in markdown formal
3. demographic_profiles.csv -- Profiles of Manus-generated synthetic students
4. survey_responses.json -- Simulated survey responses (json file)
5. simulated_responses.csv -- Simulated survey responses (CSV file)

## Google Forms link

This is the Google Form generated by the Manus-created script above: [Undergraduate Perspectives on Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)] (https://forms.gle/FXsZnWrqMFzA9KVf7)

## Prompts

All tasks were requested of Manus on March 19, 2025.

Manus was initially asked to create a script for a Google Form to use as the basis of a survey of undergraduate attitudes toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
The prompt was:

_I would like to create a script for a Google Form that will be used in a research project to survey undergraduates about their hopes and fears about artificial general intelligence. This will be used in a survey-based study to ascertain attitudes toward, anticipated uses of, anticipated risks of, possible societal benefits, and possible societal risks of AGI. It should mix Likert scale questions and open-ended questions. It should also capture important demographic details._

Manus designed the survey (survey_design.md) and generated the Googe Script (agi_survey_script.js) for generating the associated Google Form. 

Manus was then given the link to the resulting form and asked to create 1,000 synthetic responses: 

_Thank you. I would now like you to simulate 1,000 undergraduate students and complete the survey on their behalf -- the link is below. Each student should be an authentic representation of an undergraduate student in the US. The complete set of 1,000 students should be representative of the student body at a public R1 university. The form link is https://forms.gle/N4D58tv5Xeuy1j5c8._

Manus refused to populate the survey using the form on the grounds that this would trigger Google anti-spam responses, and would be unethical. It did, however, generate 1,000 simulated responses and save them to the files survey_responses.json and simulated_responses.csv.

Finally, Manus was asked to analyze the 1,000 simulated responses to the survey, and produce a detailed report from the analysis:

_I would like you to take the simulated demographic data and the responses, and analyze these as if they were real data. I would like a comprehensive report that is publishable, and that analyzes the open-ended response as well as the Likert scale responses, and teases out important insights. Again, this is a simulation and proof of concept exercise and so commentary on ethical concerns is not necessary._

The final report, along with 6 data visualizations, are included in the document ...
