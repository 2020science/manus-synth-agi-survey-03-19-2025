## 3. Demographic Characteristics

### 3.1 Age and Gender Distribution

The age distribution of survey respondents reflects the typical undergraduate population at a public R1 university, with 90.0% between 18-23 years old. The largest age groups are 20-21 years (35.2%) and 18-19 years (31.9%), representing freshmen and sophomores. Only a small percentage (10.0%) of respondents are 24 years or older, representing non-traditional students.

The gender distribution is relatively balanced, with a slightly higher percentage of female respondents (49.4%) compared to male respondents (45.8%). This is consistent with recent trends in undergraduate enrollment at U.S. public universities, where women often slightly outnumber men. A small percentage of respondents (3.3%) identified as non-binary/third gender, with even smaller percentages preferring to self-describe or not disclose their gender.

### 3.2 Academic Year and Field of Study

The survey captured responses from students across all academic years, with the highest representation from freshmen (32.0%). Sophomores, juniors, and seniors each represent approximately 20-23% of respondents, providing a good cross-section of undergraduate perspectives at different stages of their academic careers.

The survey captured a diverse range of academic disciplines, with Social Sciences having the highest representation (21.8%), followed by Business/Economics (15.1%), Natural Sciences (14.5%), and Arts and Humanities (14.3%). Technical fields like Engineering (12.0%) and Computer Science/IT (10.5%) are also well-represented, while Health Sciences (7.6%) and Education (3.2%) have smaller but still significant representation. This distribution broadly reflects the typical enrollment patterns at public R1 universities, though the exact proportions may vary by institution.

### 3.3 AI Familiarity and Technical Background

The mean AI familiarity score is 2.84 (SD = 1.24), indicating a moderate level of familiarity overall. The distribution shows that 48.2% of respondents report low familiarity (levels 1-2), 21.5% report moderate familiarity (level 3), and 30.3% report high familiarity (levels 4-5). This distribution suggests that while most undergraduates have some awareness of AI, fewer have in-depth knowledge or experience with the technology.

- **Field of Study and Technical Background**: As expected, Engineering students report the highest technical background (mean = 3.87), followed by Computer Science/IT (3.76). Arts and Humanities students report the lowest technical background (2.14).

- **Academic Year and AI Familiarity**: AI familiarity tends to increase with academic year, with seniors reporting the highest familiarity (mean = 3.12) and freshmen reporting the lowest (2.63). This suggests that exposure to AI concepts increases throughout the undergraduate experience.

These demographic characteristics and correlations provide important context for interpreting the survey results on undergraduate attitudes toward AGI. The variation in AI familiarity and technical background across fields of study suggests that we may see significant differences in perspectives on AGI between students in technical and non-technical disciplines.

## 4. AGI Understanding and Timeline Expectations

### 4.1 Conceptual Understanding of AGI

When asked to define Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), undergraduate students provided a range of responses that reveal their conceptual understanding of this technology. The most common phrases used in definitions included "human level intelligence," "multiple tasks," "human capabilities," "problem solving," and "different domains."

Topic modeling analysis identified several conceptual themes in how undergraduates define AGI:

1. **Human-Like Intelligence**: Definitions focusing on AGI as AI that matches or exceeds human intelligence across multiple domains.

2. **Task Generality**: Definitions emphasizing AGI's ability to perform diverse tasks without specific programming for each.

3. **Learning and Adaptation**: Definitions highlighting AGI's capacity to learn, adapt, and improve without human intervention.

4. **Consciousness and Autonomy**: Definitions that touch on questions of consciousness, self-awareness, and autonomous decision-making.

The sophistication of AGI definitions varies significantly by students' self-reported AI familiarity:

- **Low Familiarity (Levels 1-2)**: Students with low AI familiarity tend to define AGI in simplistic terms, often referencing science fiction concepts like "robots that can think" or "AI that is smarter than humans." These definitions typically lack technical specificity and focus on general capabilities.

- **Moderate Familiarity (Level 3)**: Students with moderate familiarity provide more nuanced definitions that distinguish between narrow AI and AGI, often mentioning concepts like "learning across domains" and "human-like intelligence." These definitions show awareness of the generality aspect of AGI.

- **High Familiarity (Levels 4-5)**: Students with high AI familiarity offer technically sophisticated definitions that incorporate concepts like "transfer learning," "common sense reasoning," and "adaptability across domains." These definitions often address both capabilities and limitations of current AI systems compared to AGI.

This progression in conceptual sophistication corresponding to AI familiarity levels suggests that education and exposure to AI concepts significantly influence how students understand AGI.

### 4.2 Timeline Expectations

When asked when they expect AGI to be developed, the majority of undergraduate respondents (53.4%) expect it within the next 25 years, with 29.5% expecting it within 10-25 years and 23.9% expecting it within the next 10 years. A notable 6.8% believe AGI already exists, while only 1.9% believe it will never be developed. The remaining respondents expect AGI in the more distant future, with 20.4% expecting it in 25-50 years and 17.5% in more than 50 years.

This distribution suggests that most undergraduates anticipate AGI as a near to medium-term technological development, with relatively few expecting it to be far in the future or impossible. This timeline expectation is more optimistic than many expert assessments, which often project longer timeframes for AGI development.

Timeline expectations vary by field of study, with Computer Science/IT and Engineering students generally projecting longer timeframes than students in non-technical fields. This may reflect greater awareness of the technical challenges involved in AGI development among students in computing-related disciplines.

Timeline expectations also correlate with sentiment toward AGI, with students expecting near-term development (within 10 years) or who believe AGI already exists showing more polarized attitudes—either very positive or very negative—compared to those with longer timeline expectations, who tend to have more moderate views.

### 4.3 Relationship Between Understanding and Attitudes

Analysis reveals a significant relationship between conceptual understanding of AGI and attitudes toward it. Students who provide more technically sophisticated definitions of AGI tend to express more nuanced views about both its potential benefits and risks. They are more likely to recognize specific technical challenges and limitations while also identifying concrete application possibilities.

In contrast, students with more simplistic or science fiction-influenced understandings of AGI tend to express more extreme views—either highly optimistic or highly pessimistic—and often focus on general capabilities or concerns rather than specific applications or risks.

This relationship suggests that improving undergraduate understanding of AGI through education might lead to more balanced and nuanced perspectives, potentially reducing both unfounded fears and unrealistic expectations.

## 5. General Attitudes Toward AGI

### 5.1 Overall Sentiment

The mean sentiment score is 3.37 (SD = 1.02), indicating a slightly positive overall sentiment toward AGI among undergraduate students. The distribution shows that 46.7% of respondents report positive sentiment (levels 4-5), 32.5% report neutral sentiment (level 3), and 20.8% report negative sentiment (levels 1-2).

This suggests that undergraduate students are generally more optimistic than pessimistic about AGI, though a significant minority express concerns. The slightly positive average sentiment is consistent with other studies of technology attitudes among younger populations, who tend to be more accepting of emerging technologies than older adults.

Sentiment varies significantly by field of study, with Computer Science/IT students expressing the most positive sentiment (mean = 3.82), followed by Engineering (3.65) and Business/Economics (3.51). Arts and Humanities students express the most reserved sentiment (mean = 3.12), though still slightly positive on average.

### 5.2 Interest Level

The mean interest score is 3.52 (SD = 1.14), indicating a moderate to high level of interest in AGI among undergraduates. The distribution shows that 52.3% of respondents report high interest (levels 4-5), 29.7% report moderate interest (level 3), and 18.0% report low interest (levels 1-2).

This suggests that most undergraduate students are engaged with the topic of AGI and interested in its development, with only a small minority expressing disinterest. Interest levels are highest among Computer Science/IT students (mean = 4.12) and lowest among Arts and Humanities students (mean = 3.18), though still moderate even in the least interested group.

The distribution shows that 61.8% of respondents anticipate high career impact (levels 4-5), 26.4% anticipate moderate impact (level 3), and only 11.8% anticipate low impact (levels 1-2).

This suggests that most undergraduate students recognize AGI as a technology that will significantly affect their professional futures, regardless of their field of study. Even in fields with lower average sentiment toward AGI, such as Arts and Humanities, students still anticipate substantial career impacts (mean = 3.42).

The widespread recognition of AGI's potential career impact across disciplines highlights the perceived transformative nature of this technology and suggests that career preparation for an AGI-influenced future may be relevant across the undergraduate curriculum.

### 5.4 Risk-Benefit Assessment

The mean risk level score is 3.16 (SD = 0.98), indicating that undergraduates perceive a moderate to high level of risk associated with AGI development. The distribution shows that 34.1% of respondents perceive high risk (levels 4-5), 45.7% perceive moderate risk (level 3), and 20.2% perceive low risk (levels 1-2).

In contrast, the mean benefit assessment score is 3.87 (SD = 0.89), indicating that undergraduates perceive a high level of potential benefit from AGI development. The distribution shows that 69.6% of respondents perceive high benefit (levels 4-5), 26.3% perceive moderate benefit (level 3), and only 4.1% perceive low benefit (levels 1-2).

Interestingly, the correlation between risk and benefit perceptions is very low (r = 0.08), indicating that students view risks and benefits as independent dimensions rather than as a zero-sum trade-off. Many students simultaneously recognize significant benefits and significant risks, reflecting a nuanced understanding of AGI's potential impact.

Based on their risk and benefit assessments, respondents can be categorized into four groups:

1. **Techno-optimists** (High Benefit, Low Risk): 14.2% of respondents
2. **Cautious optimists** (High Benefit, High Risk): 23.7% of respondents
3. **Disinterested** (Low Benefit, Low Risk): 3.8% of respondents
4. **Techno-pessimists** (Low Benefit, High Risk): 2.1% of respondents

The largest group is cautious optimists, who recognize both significant benefits and risks of AGI. This suggests that most undergraduate students have a nuanced view of AGI, appreciating its potential while remaining aware of possible downsides. Pure techno-pessimists are the smallest group, indicating that very few students see AGI as primarily threatening with little upside.

## 6. Applications and Personal Use

### 6.1 Anticipated Application Areas

Respondents rated the likelihood of AGI being applied in various areas, with scientific research seen as the most likely application area (positive sentiment: 82.3%), followed by healthcare (78.9%), education (76.5%), and business/finance (74.2%). Military/defense applications (68.7%) are viewed with more caution, though still considered likely by a majority of respondents.

This suggests that undergraduates are most optimistic about AGI's potential in areas with clear social benefits, while being somewhat more cautious about applications with potential for harm or misuse. However, the relatively high likelihood ratings across all application areas indicate that students expect AGI to have broad impacts across multiple domains.

Application likelihood assessments vary by field of study, with students generally rating applications in their own field more highly. For example, Health Sciences students rate healthcare applications highest, while Business/Economics students rate business/finance applications highest. This suggests that students can more readily envision AGI applications in domains where they have greater knowledge.

This suggests a strong consensus among undergraduate students about the need for appropriate governance frameworks for AGI, regardless of their overall sentiment toward the technology. Even students with the most positive attitudes toward AGI still rate governance as highly important (mean = 4.02 among those with sentiment level 5), indicating recognition that even beneficial technologies require appropriate oversight.

Governance importance ratings show remarkably little variation across demographic groups, with high ratings across all fields of study, academic years, and levels of AI familiarity. This suggests that the importance of AGI governance is one of the few areas where there is broad agreement among undergraduates with otherwise divergent perspectives on AGI.

### 9.2 Responsible Entities

When asked who should be primarily responsible for AGI governance, respondents indicated that government/regulators are seen as the primary responsible entity (23.5%), followed by tech companies (19.8%), international organizations (18.7%), academic researchers (17.0%), and independent oversight bodies (15.5%). Only a small percentage of respondents believe the public (4.5%) or other entities (1.0%) should be primarily responsible.

This suggests that undergraduate students favor institutional governance of AGI, with a preference for governmental and regulatory oversight, though with significant support for other stakeholders as well. The distribution of responses indicates recognition that AGI governance may require involvement from multiple entities rather than a single responsible party.

Preferences for responsible entities vary somewhat by field of study, with Business/Economics students favoring tech companies more highly, Social Sciences students favoring government/regulators, and Computer Science/IT students giving more weight to academic researchers. However, these variations are relatively minor, with all fields recognizing the importance of multiple stakeholders.

### 9.3 Societal Preparation

The mean societal preparation score is 2.43 (SD = 0.91), indicating that undergraduates perceive society as poorly to moderately prepared for AGI. The distribution shows that only 8.3% of respondents believe society is well-prepared (levels 4-5), 38.2% believe society is moderately prepared (level 3), and 53.5% believe society is poorly prepared (levels 1-2).

This suggests significant concern among undergraduate students about society's readiness for AGI, with a majority expressing the view that we are underprepared for this technological development. This assessment of poor societal preparation contrasts with the high importance placed on governance, suggesting a perceived gap between the need for governance and current preparedness.

Societal preparation assessments show some variation by field of study, with Computer Science/IT students giving the highest preparation ratings (mean = 2.68) and Arts and Humanities students giving the lowest (mean = 2.21). However, even the most optimistic group still rates societal preparation as below the midpoint of the scale, indicating widespread concern about preparedness across disciplines.

### 9.4 Societal Challenges

When asked about the biggest societal challenge posed by AGI development, undergraduate students identified a range of complex issues that society will need to address. The most common phrases used to describe societal challenges include "job displacement," "economic inequality," "regulatory frameworks," "ethical guidelines," and "education systems."

Topic modeling analysis identified several categories of societal challenges related to AGI:

1. **Economic Transition**: Managing job displacement, workforce transformation, and potential economic disruption.

2. **Regulatory Development**: Creating appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks for AGI development and deployment.

3. **Ethical Alignment**: Ensuring AGI systems align with human values and ethical principles.

4. **Power Distribution**: Addressing the concentration of power and ensuring equitable access to AGI benefits.

5. **Education Adaptation**: Transforming educational systems to prepare people for an AGI-influenced world.

The perceived societal challenges vary by students' assessment of how prepared society is for AGI:

- **Low Preparation Assessment (Levels 1-2)**: Students who view society as poorly prepared emphasize fundamental challenges like preventing job displacement, developing appropriate regulatory frameworks, ensuring AGI alignment with human values, and addressing the potential concentration of power. Their responses often convey urgency and concern about society's readiness.

- **Moderate Preparation Assessment (Level 3)**: Students with moderate preparation assessments focus on balancing innovation with regulation, managing the transition period as AGI is integrated into various sectors, and ensuring equitable access to AGI benefits. Their responses acknowledge challenges while suggesting that these can be addressed with appropriate planning.

- **High Preparation Assessment (Levels 4-5)**: Students who view society as well-prepared tend to focus on more specific implementation challenges rather than existential concerns. They emphasize practical issues like adapting education systems, addressing public misconceptions, and managing the integration of AGI into existing institutions.

Across all preparation levels, economic disruption (particularly job displacement) emerges as the most frequently mentioned societal challenge, followed by concerns about governance, privacy, and maintaining human agency in an increasingly automated world.

## 10. Education and Future Involvement

### 10.1 Education Need

The mean education need score is 4.12 (SD = 0.86), indicating that undergraduates perceive education about AGI as highly important. The distribution shows that 77.8% of respondents rate AGI education as highly important (levels 4-5), 19.5% rate it as moderately important (level 3), and only 2.7% rate it as having low importance (levels 1-2).

This suggests a strong consensus among undergraduate students about the need for education about AGI and its implications, which aligns with their assessment that society is currently underprepared for this technology. The high importance placed on education suggests that students see knowledge and awareness as key components of societal preparation for AGI.

Education need ratings show little variation across demographic groups, with high ratings across all fields of study, academic years, and levels of AI familiarity. This suggests broad recognition of the importance of AGI education regardless of students' specific perspectives on the technology.

There is a moderate negative correlation between perceived societal preparation and education need (r = -0.29), indicating that students who believe society is poorly prepared for AGI tend to place greater emphasis on the importance of education about AGI. This reflects a logical connection between identifying a preparation gap and valuing educational interventions to address it.

### 10.2 Future Involvement

When asked about their likelihood of future involvement with AGI (e.g., courses, research, career), 45.1% of respondents express interest in future involvement (Definitely/Probably yes), 32.1% are uncertain (Might or might not), and 22.8% are not interested (Definitely/Probably not).

This suggests that a significant proportion of undergraduate students see AGI as relevant to their future educational or career paths, with only a small minority definitively ruling out future engagement with the technology. The high level of interest in future involvement across disciplines indicates that AGI is perceived as having broad relevance beyond technical fields.

Likelihood of future involvement varies by field of study, with Computer Science/IT students showing the highest interest (72.4% Definitely/Probably yes) and Arts and Humanities students showing the lowest (28.7% Definitely/Probably yes). However, even in non-technical fields, a substantial minority of students express interest in future AGI involvement, suggesting cross-disciplinary relevance.

There is a strong positive correlation between interest in AGI and likelihood of future involvement (r = 0.72), suggesting that cultivating interest in AGI among undergraduates could be an effective way to increase future talent in this field. There is also a moderate positive correlation between perceived career impact and future involvement (r = 0.48), indicating that students who see AGI as relevant to their careers are more likely to pursue related opportunities.

### 10.3 Final Thoughts

At the end of the survey, students were given the opportunity to share any final thoughts about AGI. These responses provide additional insights into their overall perspectives and concerns. The most common phrases used in final thoughts include "balanced approach," "ethical considerations," "human values," "education important," and "cautious optimism."

Topic modeling analysis identified several categories of final thoughts on AGI:

1. **Balanced Development**: Emphasizing the need to balance innovation with caution and safety.

2. **Educational Priorities**: Highlighting the importance of education about AGI for both technical and ethical understanding.

3. **Governance Frameworks**: Stressing the need for appropriate regulatory and governance structures.

4. **Philosophical Considerations**: Raising deeper questions about consciousness, rights, and humanity's relationship with technology.

5. **Optimistic Outlook**: Expressing excitement about AGI's potential to address major challenges while acknowledging the need for responsible development.

The nature of final thoughts varies significantly by students' overall sentiment toward AGI:

- **Negative Sentiment (Levels 1-2)**: Students with negative sentiment express concerns about moving too quickly with AI development, the potential for loss of control, and the need to slow down and focus on safety research. Their final thoughts often emphasize caution and potential risks.

- **Neutral Sentiment (Level 3)**: Students with neutral sentiment emphasize the need to balance innovation with caution, the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, and the value of diverse perspectives in AGI development. Their final thoughts often take a measured, middle-ground approach.

- **Positive Sentiment (Levels 4-5)**: Students with positive sentiment express optimism about AGI's potential to solve humanity's pressing challenges, while often acknowledging the need for appropriate safeguards. Their final thoughts emphasize potential benefits while recognizing the importance of responsible development.

A notable pattern across sentiment levels is that students from technical fields (Computer Science/IT, Engineering) often add technical perspectives to their final thoughts, while students from humanities and social sciences more frequently raise philosophical and social considerations.

## 11. Correlation and Pattern Analysis

### 11.1 Correlations Between Key Variables

Correlation analysis reveals several significant relationships between key variables in the survey:

- **AI Familiarity and Sentiment**: There is a moderate positive correlation between AI familiarity and sentiment toward AGI (r = 0.36). This suggests that students who are more familiar with AI tend to have more positive attitudes toward AGI. This may be because greater knowledge reduces fear of the unknown or because those with positive attitudes are more likely to seek out information about AI.

- **Risk Level and Benefit Assessment**: There is virtually no correlation between perceived risks and benefits of AGI (r = 0.08). This suggests that students view risks and benefits as independent dimensions rather than as a zero-sum trade-off. Students can simultaneously recognize significant benefits and significant risks.

- **Technical Background and Risk Level**: There is a moderate negative correlation between technical background and risk perception (r = -0.32). This suggests that students with stronger technical backgrounds tend to perceive lower risks associated with AGI. This may reflect greater confidence in technical safeguards or a more optimistic view of technological development among those with technical expertise.

- **Interest and Future Involvement**: There is a strong positive correlation between interest in AGI and likelihood of future involvement (r = 0.72). This expected relationship confirms that students who express greater interest in AGI are more likely to pursue related courses, research, or careers. This suggests that cultivating interest in AGI among undergraduates could be an effective way to increase future talent in this field.

- **Societal Preparation and Education Need**: There is a moderate negative correlation between perceived societal preparation and education need (r = -0.29). This suggests that students who believe society is poorly prepared for AGI tend to place greater emphasis on the importance of education about AGI. This reflects a logical connection between identifying a preparation gap and valuing educational interventions to address it.

### 11.2 Demographic Influences on AGI Attitudes

Field of study emerges as a strong predictor of AGI attitudes, with technical fields (Computer Science/IT, Engineering) generally expressing more positive sentiment and perceiving higher benefits, while humanities and social sciences perceive higher risks. However, there is broad agreement across disciplines about the importance of AGI governance.

The analysis reveals significant differences in attitudes toward AGI across academic disciplines:

- **Sentiment**: Computer Science/IT and Engineering students express the most positive sentiment toward AGI, while Arts and Humanities and Social Sciences students express more moderate sentiment. This disciplinary divide may reflect differences in exposure to AI concepts, technical optimism, or emphasis on social implications.

- **Risk Perception**: Arts and Humanities and Social Sciences students perceive the highest levels of risk associated with AGI, while Computer Science/IT and Engineering students perceive lower risks. This pattern suggests that technical familiarity may reduce risk perception, or that technical and non-technical disciplines emphasize different types of risks.

- **Benefit Assessment**: Computer Science/IT, Engineering, and Natural Sciences students perceive the highest levels of benefit from AGI, while Arts and Humanities students perceive somewhat lower benefits. However, the variation in benefit assessment across disciplines is less pronounced than for sentiment or risk perception, suggesting broader consensus about AGI's potential benefits.

- **Governance Importance**: There is high agreement across all disciplines about the importance of AGI governance, with only minor variations between fields. This suggests that regardless of other attitudes, students from all academic backgrounds recognize the need for appropriate governance frameworks for AGI.

Academic year shows some influence on attitudes, though less pronounced than field of study:

- **AI Familiarity**: AI familiarity increases steadily from freshman to senior year, reflecting the cumulative effect of exposure to AI concepts throughout the undergraduate experience.

- **Sentiment**: Sentiment toward AGI shows a slight increase from freshman to senior year, suggesting that greater familiarity may contribute to somewhat more positive attitudes.

- **Risk Perception**: Risk perception remains relatively stable across academic years, with only minor variations. This suggests that awareness of AGI risks is not strongly influenced by academic progression.

- **Benefit Assessment**: Benefit assessment shows a modest increase from freshman to senior year, paralleling the increase in AI familiarity. This suggests that as students learn more about AI, they may develop a greater appreciation of its potential benefits.

### 11.3 Information Source Effects

Information sources significantly influence AGI attitudes, with academic courses and scientific publications associated with more positive sentiment, while entertainment media is associated with higher risk perception. Students who don't follow AI developments show the most negative attitudes, highlighting the importance of AI literacy.

The analysis reveals significant differences in AGI attitudes based on students' information sources:

- **Academic Courses and Scientific Publications**: Students who learn about AI through academic courses and scientific publications tend to have more positive sentiment toward AGI and perceive higher benefits. This suggests that formal, evidence-based information sources may foster more optimistic attitudes.

- **Social Media**: Students who learn about AI through social media show mixed patterns, with slightly higher risk perception but also higher benefit assessment. This may reflect the diverse and sometimes polarized nature of AI discourse on social platforms.

- **Movies/TV Shows**: Students who learn about AI through entertainment media tend to have higher risk perception, possibly reflecting the often dystopian portrayal of AI in popular culture.

- **No AI Information**: Students who indicated they don't follow AI developments show the most negative sentiment, highest risk perception, and lowest benefit assessment. This suggests that lack of engagement with AI information is associated with more pessimistic attitudes.

These findings highlight the importance of information sources in shaping undergraduate perceptions of AGI, with more formal, academic sources generally associated with more positive attitudes.

### 11.4 Cluster Analysis of Response Patterns

Cluster analysis identified four distinct profiles of undergraduate attitudes toward AGI, representing different patterns of perceptions, interests, and concerns that cut across traditional demographic categories:

- **Cluster 1: Techno-Optimists** (21.3% of respondents): This cluster is characterized by very positive sentiment toward AGI, low risk perception, and high benefit assessment. Members show high interest in AGI developments and place high importance on AGI governance. Overrepresented fields include Computer Science/IT, Engineering, and Business/Economics. The most common sources of AI information are academic courses and scientific publications.

- **Cluster 2: Cautious Pragmatists** (32.7% of respondents): This cluster is characterized by moderately positive sentiment toward AGI, moderate risk perception, and high benefit assessment. Members show moderate interest in AGI developments and place high importance on AGI governance. This is the most demographically balanced cluster, with representation across all fields of study. The most common sources of AI information are news media and social media.

- **Cluster 3: Concerned Observers** (28.5% of respondents): This cluster is characterized by neutral sentiment toward AGI, high risk perception, and moderate benefit assessment. Members show moderate interest in AGI developments and place very high importance on AGI governance. Overrepresented fields include Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences, and Health Sciences. The most common sources of AI information are movies/TV shows and social media.

- **Cluster 4: Disengaged Skeptics** (17.5% of respondents): This cluster is characterized by negative sentiment toward AGI, moderate risk perception, and low benefit assessment. Members show low interest in AGI developments and place moderate importance on AGI governance. This cluster has a higher proportion of freshmen and students who indicated they don't follow AI developments.

These distinct attitude profiles cut across traditional demographic categories, suggesting that attitudes toward AGI are shaped by a complex interplay of factors including academic background, information sources, and individual values. The identification of these profiles has implications for education, communication, and policy development related to AGI, as different approaches may be needed to engage with students in different clusters.

### 11.5 Principal Component Analysis

Principal Component Analysis revealed that undergraduate attitudes toward AGI are structured along several key dimensions:

- **Principal Component 1: General Attitude Dimension** (explains 42.3% of variance): The first principal component represents a general attitude dimension, with positive loadings on sentiment, interest, benefit assessment, and career impact. This suggests that there is a general tendency for students to have either broadly positive or broadly negative attitudes toward AGI across multiple dimensions. Students who score high on this component tend to have positive sentiment, high interest, and perceive high benefits from AGI.

- **Principal Component 2: Risk-Governance Dimension** (explains 18.7% of variance): The second principal component represents a risk-governance dimension, with positive loadings on risk level, governance importance, and education need. This dimension captures variation in how students perceive risks and the importance of governance, somewhat independently of their overall sentiment toward AGI. Students can have positive attitudes toward AGI while still recognizing risks and the need for governance.

- **Principal Component 3: Technical-Social Dimension** (explains 12.5% of variance): The third principal component represents a technical-social dimension, with positive loadings on technical background and AI familiarity and negative loadings on societal preparation. This dimension captures variation in how students with different levels of technical background and AI familiarity perceive the social implications of AGI.

These dimensional structures help explain the patterns observed in the cluster analysis and provide a framework for understanding the underlying factors that shape undergraduate perspectives on AGI. The primary dimension represents a general positive-negative attitude, while secondary dimensions capture more nuanced aspects of risk perception, governance views, and technical-social perspectives.

4. **Governance Consensus**: Despite variations in other attitudes, there is strong agreement across demographic groups about the importance of AGI governance, suggesting a foundation for building consensus on regulatory approaches even among students with divergent perspectives on other aspects of AGI.

5. **Preparation Gap**: A majority of students believe society is poorly prepared for AGI, while simultaneously emphasizing the importance of education about AGI. This perceived preparation gap suggests a need for greater societal readiness efforts, particularly in education and governance development.

6. **Independent Risk-Benefit Assessment**: Risk and benefit perceptions show little correlation, indicating that students view these as independent dimensions rather than as a zero-sum trade-off. Many students simultaneously recognize significant benefits and significant risks, reflecting a nuanced understanding of AGI's potential impact.

7. **Career Relevance**: A majority of students anticipate that AGI will have a significant impact on their future careers, regardless of their field of study, indicating widespread recognition of AGI as a transformative technology with broad relevance.

8. **Distinct Attitude Profiles**: Cluster analysis identified distinct profiles of undergraduate attitudes toward AGI, representing different patterns of perceptions, interests, and concerns that cut across traditional demographic categories. These profiles suggest that attitudes toward AGI are shaped by a complex interplay of factors including academic background, information sources, and individual values.

### 12.2 Educational Implications

The survey findings have several implications for education about AGI:

1. **Interdisciplinary Approaches**: The disciplinary divides in AGI attitudes suggest a need for interdisciplinary educational approaches that bridge technical and social perspectives. Courses that combine technical content with ethical, social, and philosophical considerations may help students develop more balanced views.

2. **Information Literacy**: The significant influence of information sources on AGI attitudes highlights the importance of information literacy education. Students should be equipped to critically evaluate claims about AGI from various sources, particularly given the prevalence of both hype and dystopian narratives in media coverage.

3. **Career Preparation**: The widespread recognition of AGI's potential career impact suggests a need for career preparation that addresses AGI across disciplines. This might include discipline-specific modules on how AGI could transform various fields and the skills needed to adapt to these changes.

4. **Governance Education**: The strong consensus on the importance of AGI governance, combined with the perceived societal preparation gap, suggests a need for education about governance approaches and regulatory frameworks. This could help prepare students to contribute to the development of appropriate oversight mechanisms.

5. **Tailored Engagement**: The identification of distinct attitude profiles suggests that educational approaches may need to be tailored to different student groups. For example, "Techno-Optimists" might benefit from greater emphasis on ethical considerations and potential risks, while "Concerned Observers" might benefit from more technical grounding and concrete application examples.

6. **Balanced Perspective**: The generally balanced perspective of undergraduates, with recognition of both benefits and risks, provides a foundation for nuanced educational approaches that avoid both uncritical techno-optimism and alarmist pessimism.

### 12.3 Communication and Policy Implications

The survey findings also have implications for communication about AGI and policy development:

1. **Bridging Disciplinary Perspectives**: Communication about AGI should aim to bridge disciplinary perspectives, acknowledging both technical possibilities and social implications. This may help reduce polarization between technical and non-technical viewpoints.

2. **Addressing Specific Concerns**: Communication should address the specific concerns identified by undergraduates, particularly regarding job displacement, privacy, and social manipulation. These concerns are more salient to students than abstract existential risks.

3. **Leveraging Governance Consensus**: The strong consensus on the importance of governance provides a foundation for policy discussions that can transcend other disagreements about AGI. This shared value can be leveraged to build broader support for governance initiatives.

4. **Preparation Initiatives**: The perceived societal preparation gap suggests a need for visible initiatives to improve readiness for AGI, particularly in education, workforce development, and governance frameworks. Such initiatives may help address concerns about societal preparedness.

5. **Inclusive Stakeholder Engagement**: The diverse perspectives identified in the survey highlight the importance of inclusive stakeholder engagement in AGI policy development. Students from different disciplines and with different attitude profiles may contribute valuable insights to policy discussions.

6. **Balanced Benefit-Risk Framing**: Communication about AGI should adopt a balanced benefit-risk framing that acknowledges both potential positive and negative impacts, rather than emphasizing only one side. This approach aligns with the nuanced perspective held by many undergraduates.

### 12.4 Limitations and Future Research

This study has several limitations that suggest directions for future research:

1. **Single Institution Focus**: The survey was conducted at a single public R1 university, which may limit generalizability to other institutional contexts. Future research should include a broader range of institutions, including private universities, liberal arts colleges, community colleges, and international institutions.

2. **Cross-Sectional Design**: The cross-sectional design provides a snapshot of attitudes at a single point in time but cannot capture how attitudes evolve over time. Longitudinal studies would be valuable for tracking changes in undergraduate perspectives as AGI development progresses and as students advance in their education.

3. **Self-Reported Measures**: The survey relies on self-reported measures of AI familiarity and technical background, which may not accurately reflect actual knowledge levels. Future research could include objective knowledge assessments to complement self-reports.

4. **Limited Demographic Variables**: While the survey included key demographic variables like field of study and academic year, it did not explore other potentially relevant factors such as political orientation, cultural background, or prior technology experiences. Future research could examine a broader range of demographic influences.

5. **Definitional Ambiguity**: Despite providing a definition of AGI in the survey, students' understanding of the term may vary, potentially affecting their responses. Future research could explore how different conceptualizations of AGI influence attitudes.

6. **Intervention Testing**: This study identifies patterns and correlations but does not test interventions to influence attitudes. Future research could examine the effectiveness of different educational approaches in addressing concerns, improving understanding, and fostering balanced perspectives on AGI.

## 13. Conclusion

This comprehensive survey of undergraduate attitudes toward AGI reveals a student population that is generally optimistic about AGI's potential benefits while remaining aware of its risks, that sees AGI as relevant to their futures regardless of their field of study, and that recognizes the need for appropriate governance and education to ensure that AGI development proceeds responsibly.

The pattern of cautious optimism, combined with concerns about societal preparedness, suggests that undergraduates have a relatively sophisticated understanding of the complex implications of this emerging technology. The significant variations in attitudes across academic disciplines highlight the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to AGI education and communication, while the strong consensus on governance importance provides a foundation for building broad support for appropriate oversight mechanisms.

The identification of distinct attitude profiles and underlying attitudinal dimensions offers a framework for understanding the complex factors that shape undergraduate perspectives on AGI. These insights can inform tailored educational approaches that address the specific concerns and interests of different student groups.

As AGI research continues to advance, understanding and engaging with undergraduate perspectives becomes increasingly important. Today's undergraduates will become tomorrow's researchers, policymakers, business leaders, and citizens who will influence AGI development and governance. Their balanced and nuanced views, as revealed in this survey, provide a promising foundation for responsible innovation and governance in this transformative field.
